# ROS2-TurtleBot3-Maze-Navigation
Created a custom maze world in Gazebo and used a TurtleBot3 robot to map and autonomously navigate it using SLAM (Cartographer) and Nav2.


## üöÄ Features
- Created a custom maze environment in Gazebo based on a generated maze.
- Used **Cartographer SLAM** to build the map.
- Refined the map manually in GIMP for better accuracy.
- Used **Nav2** with 2D Pose Estimate and Nav2 Goals to autonomously navigate the maze.
- Problem-solved various launch files, mapping, and navigation issues to achieve smooth end-to-end robot navigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- ROS 2 (Humble)  
- TurtleBot3 Simulation Packages  
- Gazebo  
- Cartographer SLAM  
- Nav2 (Navigation2)  
- GIMP (for manual map editing)
- Python

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a Maze Layout
I began by using an online maze generator to create a 2D maze layout. This provided the blueprint for my simulation environment.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Import Maze into Gazebo
I launched Gazebo and imported the generated maze image.  
In Gazebo, I traced the 2D maze image to build a **3D version** of the maze using walls and obstacles. This gave me a full 3D maze environment for the TurtleBot3 to explore.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the World and Add a Launch File
Once the maze was complete:
- I saved the world as `project1.world` inside the `worlds/` folder of the `turtlebot3_gazebo` package.
- I created a new launch file named `turtlebot3_project1.launch.py` (copied and modified from `turtlebot3_house.launch.py`) inside the `launch/` folder of the same package.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Maze World in Gazebo
Build your workspace and launch the custom world:

cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_project1.launch.py

This spawns a TurtleBot3 in your custom maze world inside Gazebo.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Cartographer SLAM

Start SLAM to generate a map while the robot explores:

ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True

This opens RViz2 with Cartographer running, ready to map the environment.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Teleoperate the Robot to Build the Map

Manually drive the robot around to build the map:

ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard


Use the keyboard to navigate through all corridors so the Cartographer can produce a complete map.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Save the Map

Once the map is sufficiently built:

ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f maps/project1


This saves two files: project1.yaml and project1.pgm in the maps/ directory.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Up the Map

The SLAM-generated map may contain noise or slight misalignments.
I opened the .pgm file in GIMP and manually cleaned up the lines and walls to better reflect the actual maze layout.

**Before:**

**After:**

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Run Navigation2 with the Clean Map

With a clean map saved, launch Nav2 to enable autonomous navigation:

ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=maps/project1.yaml

**Map at Launch**

### üîü Localize and Set Navigation Goals in RViz2

In RViz2:

Use 2D Pose Estimate to set the robot‚Äôs initial pose on the map.

Use Nav2 Goal to set a destination within the maze.

The TurtleBot3 will plan and execute a path through the maze using the cleaned map.


**Map when Finished Nav2 goal reached:**

## üêç Python

You can also automate setting the initial pose and sending goals with Python instead of clicking in RViz2.  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Observe the initial pose topic**  
Run the following to see the topic used for setting the robot‚Äôs initial position:  

ros2 topic echo /initialpose

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new Python script using the Simple Commander API
Navigate to your package‚Äôs scripts directory and create a new file:


cd <your_workspace>/<package_name>/scripts
touch nav2_python_practice.py
chmod +x nav2_python_practice.py
code nav2_python_practice.py   # open in VS Code

3Ô∏è‚É£ Write your Python code
Inside nav2_python_practice.py, add code to set the initial pose and navigation goals.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Putting It All Together
After writing your code and preparing your map:

4Ô∏è‚É£ Launch your TurtleBot3 world in Gazebo


ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py

5Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Navigation2 with your chosen map
Replace my_map.yaml with the map you want:


ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=maps/my_map.yaml

6Ô∏è‚É£ Build a map if needed
When creating a map for the first time, run Cartographer instead of Nav2 to build the map.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Run your Python script to send initial pose and goals

./nav2_python_practice

8Ô∏è‚É£ Alternatively, use the Nav2 bringup launch file with your map


ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup_launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=maps/my_map.yaml

This flow lets you:
(1) spawn the robot, 
(2) start navigation with your chosen map, 
(3) drive navigation goals programmatically via Python instead of clicking in RViz2.

## üß© Challenges and Problem-Solving

Map Noise: The initial Cartographer map had small errors; manual editing in GIMP improved navigation accuracy.

Launch Integration: Creating a dedicated launch file for the custom world streamlined running Gazebo with the new maze.

Localization: Ensured correct pose estimation before sending goals to Nav2 to prevent path planning failures.

## üìå Future Improvements

Test different SLAM packages (Hector SLAM, GMapping) for comparison.

Add dynamic obstacles to evaluate path replanning.
